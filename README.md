# CodeceptJS Project

This is a basic starting point for a new CodeceptJS project. It includes the default configuration and dependencies to get started with end-to-end testing.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. Run tests:

   ```sh
   npx codeceptjs run
   ```

## Project Structure

- `codecept.conf.js`: Main configuration file for CodeceptJS.
- `tests/`: Directory for your test files.
